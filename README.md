# Colline
Colline is an open source AI system. The code, originally developed in 2001-2003 has not been touched since then

The current code (Oct 6th 2019), along with the documentation (see folder) should be enough to get us started.

Once we get this thing going we can use the subreddit r/Colline to share progress and also discuss the implications for our current worldview in order to mature this. Strong AI should go hand in hand with an ethical mindset and should therefor also be open source and not placed in the hands of some privately owned company.

Looking forward to following the progress!
